# Program-Review-Metric-Automation
This is a Python program that I made for my first co-op as a program coordinator!
It automatically computes and exports multiple metrics from Mavenlink into weekly review program presentations 
I created this so that the project managers at my workplace didn't need to manually enter their data into their program presentations every week.
